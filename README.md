# sci-rocket-test-data

This repo contains a snakemake workflow that generates the genome and read test data used for CI testing of sci-rocket.

## data included in repo

- reads
  - fastq_from_aviti: 100k paired fastq reads (R1 and R2) from an AVITI run
  - fastq_from_bcl: 100k paired fastq reads (R1 and R2) from an Illumina run

## data generated by workflow

- genome
  - Danio_rerio gtf and fa files (chromosome 25 only)
- reads
  - fastq_from_aviti
    - one_run: single run with 100k reads
    - two_runs: two runs with 50k reads each, same data as one_run but split across two runs
  - fastq_from_bcl
    - one_run: single run with 100k reads
    - two_runs: two runs with 50k reads each, same data as one_run but split across two runs

## running locally

`snakemake --use-conda`

## CI

On every push to main, the workflow is automatically executed,
and the resulting test data tarball is uploaded to github pages,
which can be downloaded from keegan.ch/sci-rocket-test-data/test-data.tgz

TODO: should probably upload to release on tagged commits instead & disable github pages.
