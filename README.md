# sci-rocket-test-data

This repo contains a snakemake workflow that generates the genome and read test data used for CI testing of sci-rocket.

Download the latest [test-data.tgz](https://github.com/lauren-saunders-lab/sci-rocket-test-data/releases/latest/download/test-data.tgz)

Or get a specific tagged version of the dataset, e.g. [2025.11.03](https://github.com/lauren-saunders-lab/sci-rocket-test-data/releases/download/2025.11.03/test-data.tgz)

## data included in repo

- reads
  - fastq_from_aviti: 100k paired fastq reads (R1 and R2) from an AVITI run
  - fastq_from_bcl: 100k paired fastq reads (R1 and R2) from an Illumina run

## data generated by workflow

- genome
  - Danio_rerio gtf and fa files (chromosome 25 only)
- reads
  - fastq_from_aviti
    - one_run: single run with 100k reads
    - two_runs: two runs with 50k reads each (same data when combined as one_run above)
  - fastq_from_bcl
    - one_run: single run with 100k reads
    - two_runs: two runs with 50k reads each (same data when combined as one_run above)
  - bcl (same data as fastq_from_bcl, but in bcl format)
    - one_run: single run with 100k reads
    - two_runs: two runs with 50k reads each (same data when combined as one_run above)

## running locally

To run the workflow and generate the test data, [install snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html), then do:

`snakemake --use-conda --cores all`

## updating the test data

After making your changes, commit and push them to check that the CI runs without errors.
Then tag this commit with today's date to trigger the CI to create a new release:

```
git tag 2025.12.01
git push origin 2025.12.01
```
